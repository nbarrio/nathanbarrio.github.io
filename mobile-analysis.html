<h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
<p>Mobile browsing can take time to know how to use. When you want to do something quick and easy then it comes in handy using a mobile device. However, when you want to work and do a lot of stuff in the internet then it is not efficient and it is really time-consuming to use your phone. Not to mention that it drains your gigabytes of data. I consider mobile browsing really convinient, specially when your day consists of walking around everywhere everyday. However, you are limited on what you can do without bumping into problems each time. </p>

<h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
<li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
<li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
<li>Any frustrations?</li>
<li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Findings</h2>
<!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
<h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
<p>I will have to say no because the mobile site is just a tiny part of the complete desktop site. The sites sometimes decide to not include some information that we might be looking for. So in most of the times I see what I wanted to see, but in some other times no.</p>
<h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
<p>I found it relatively easy to find things because most of the major sites have a mobile website. However, when you visit a page that has a lot of options and an extended navigation bar then it becomes a burden to just think of searching the web. I did find everything I looked for, but it took me some time to find it.</p>
<h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
<p>You can achieve what you want to do, but as a college student you have no time to be clicking and scrolling around. Now, most college students do not have the income to get a brand new phone with the latest hardware, so searching in the internet can be a pain in the butt. So going back to the question, yes you can achieve what you want to, however not in a very efficient way and it usually takes more time than you usually would in a computer.</p>
<h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
<p>I had a couple of frustrations. Some websites were really choppy and glitched, so whenever you wanted to click on something then you would jump and click an incorrect link. Then you had to back and reload the page all over again and scroll down until you find whatever you wanted to click. Another frustration was that some websites seemed either really heavy to load or just the server was kind of slow, so it made you impatient.
An example is facebook, there are too many places to click and too many pictures and videos to load, so it took a while to load the next page, and it sometimes glitched and jumped from one place to another, making my click on the incorrect link. Another frustration is when you visit email or social sites they usually tell you to download the mobile app, and finding a "log in" button can get difficult.</p>
<h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
<p>I think that when you are looking for a picture or something easy to find then it worked better on small screen. However, when you searched a very popular site then the experience wasn't as pleasant. Everything was harder to find and it seemed like you would never end scrolling down to find anything.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I learned that mobile browsing is important. There are hundreds of factors that the developers need to think about, and that even one small mistake can cost them a user. When someone wants to make their website mobile then the information needs to be easy to access, and not heavy to load. Information is important for the users, because if the reach their desired webpage and can't find anything easily then most likely they wont use that website again. </p>

<h2>List of sites</h2>
<!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
